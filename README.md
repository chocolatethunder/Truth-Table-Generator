**Created for:** CPSC 331 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Their Analysis

**Description:** Generates a truth table from a given expression in the command line.

**Overview**

This program was created to use Java to solve simple logical expressions and create a truth table from them. It used a very simple syntax where it would accept alphabet letters from a to z or A to Z as independent variables, ( and ) as a way to separate subexpressions, and \*(AND) +(OR) -(NOT) as operators. It would then display a set of logical subsexpressions and the truth table in its entirety.
